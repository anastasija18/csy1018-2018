            <h3>Review based on CodePen</h3>
            <h4>What do you like best? </h4>
            <p>I found that this site was easy to use due to the fact that it instantly shows any changes you make to the code, for example it gives you an instant preview under the code. I enjoy this feature due to the reason it gives me the opportunity to alter any visual changes I like to make before finalising my work. Something I found beneficial about this website is that it allows developers to test any idea they may have before actually including it in their page. The quality of the colours are useful as it allows developers to see how they would look on an actual webpage.</p>
            <h4>What would you change?</h4>
            <p>The feature I, personally, didn't enjoy is that code can be shared as someone could easisly use your code. However, to an extent it is helpful as it shares ideas with others who are attempting something similar.</p>
            <h4>Would you recommend this site?</h4>
            <p>Yes, I would definitely recommend this site to other memebers who are involved in the Web Development industry as the sharing of code will provide new ideas while keeping originality.</p>
