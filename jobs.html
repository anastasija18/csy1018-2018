            <h3>Comparison between a front-end developer and a back-end developer</h3>
            <h4>What does a front-end developer do?</h4>
            <p>A front-end developer will produce everything that the  users see. This will include designs and some lanuages such as HTML and CSS. A common front-end job title is " web designer", while in some companies they may do different things to what a front-end developer may do in another company. An example may be that some web designers use programs such as Photoshop and Fireworks to design a website without accessing any code. However, in another company a web designer may be responsible for using languages such as HTML and CSS (potentially even JavaScript) as well as using programs such as Photoshop. A front-end developer doesn't require a back-end developer to create a site. </p>
            <h4>What does a back-end developer do?</h4>
            <p>Back-end can also be reffered as "server-side". A back-end developer usually makes how the site works, updates and changes. The back-end developer produces everything that the user cannot see such as serves and databases. A usual title for back-end developer is "programmers" or "developers". Something back-end developers do is security, structure and ocntent management.  </p>
