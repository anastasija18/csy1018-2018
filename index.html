            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>You’d think it’s simple enough to write an introduction stating the key elements of it. Proven difficult even though I produced the entire thing! The purpose of this website is to educate readers and express our, students, knowledge is an accessible manner. Anyway, this newspaper is all about web development and web developers, the jobs they do, comparing a few of them to give an insight of the differences there are. Within a page, there is reviews based on current web related resources. An attempt was made to create a useful glossary containing any terminology in relation to web development. Outsiders may refer to those terms as ‘gibberish’ but I strived to make it as English as possible. It’d be pointless to have just a few terms in the glossary and no demonstrations of what they are- so, on one of the webpages there is a tutorial presenting how to apply the action to your own work.</p>
            <h3>Am I a computer nerd?</h3>
            <p>So, you’re probably wondering if I am a computer nerd who stares at computers all day and in fact no, I’m not. I am Anastasija, and considering I am petrified of ducks, there sure is a lot of them at this university. About me, almost as difficult as writing an introduction for this website… Well, I study Business Computing (Web Development), in my first year. Some modules are extremely fascinating, the rest drain me more than the two hour bus journey I have to and from university. I am obsessed with my dog, those who follow me on Instagram or have me on snapchat may know this already. He’s a little brindle pug and is without an argument the cutest. I’m not too sure if everyone has the same spending habits as me, but it’s difficult to keep up financially with this addiction. Mum and dad would agree. My favourite things to buy are expensive things I don’t need, stuff I’ll never use and things I don’t like.</p>
